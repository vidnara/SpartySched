# Credit For Sources Used to Help Make This Project

The main inspiration for this project came from Sailesh Kumar(user @sailesh307)'s health application under the title "health_app"

Much of the functionality and screens as well as the idea for a chat feature came from their code, so please make sure to check out his project as well. However, obviously

changes had to be made because that app was designed for medical professionals and patients rather than tutors and students.

In terms of integrating the database though, I followed this youtube playlist created by YT user "Mitch Koko"
